# consent-api-js
Fork of the JavaScript Consent API in [rlankhorst/wp-consent-level-api](https://github.com/rlankhorst/wp-consent-level-api).

Removes the PHP-based API entirely in favor of the JS-only consent API.

**Note:** In order for linting to work properly, `eslint` must already be installed and exist globally.
